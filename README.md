# Personal Planner

Are you obsessed with organization and planning? Is time management not a skill that comes naturally for you? Would you like one location to organize all of your thoughts and priorities? If you said yes to any of these questions- our app is for you!! 
Description: 
In the age of an attention economy, the personal organizer app provides an oasis from the constant bombardment of ads, pop ups and suggestions that hog up all of the users attention.  This is a safe place which allows a user to have their own personal space to take a moment to organize and collect their thoughts for the week. It is especially helpful for people with ADHD due to its simple design, keeping the user focused and present throughout the day.
