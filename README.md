Description: Describe at a high level what your project is and the motivation for the project (i.e., what problem(s) your projects solves) and includes a screenshot of the application in the browser.

The primary movation for the project is for personal use. I wanted my very own home page where I can start and plan my day and be away from the ever invasive ever intrusive design of modern digital content. This is a personal space that is still on a screen where I can calm down, collect my thoughts and organize.
